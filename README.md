# Cold Engine

Welcome to the **Cold Engine** repository! ðŸŽ¨ðŸš€  
This is a work-in-progress **3D graphics engine** built using **C++** and **OpenGL**, designed for developers and enthusiasts exploring real-time rendering.

---

## Features

1. **OBJ File Support**  
   You can upload and render **.obj** files directly with the engine.

2. **Basic Lighting**  
   - Implemented **Phong Shading Model** for realistic lighting and material interactions.  
   - **Shadows** are currently under development to enhance scene realism.

3. **Cross-Platform Compatibility**  
   - Works on **macOS** (optimized for Apple M-series chips) and **Windows** systems.
